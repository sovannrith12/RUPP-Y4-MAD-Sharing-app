LinkKeep - Your Personal Content Manager

Problem Statement:

In the age of information overload, users frequently discover valuable links (articles, videos, restaurants, shopping items) across various platforms. The common methods for saving these links—such as sharing to a dedicated chat, saving to a device's Notes app, or using a browser's Save feature—lead to a highly disorganized and cluttered collection. This makes finding specific saved content later a frustrating and time-consuming task.

There is a need for a localized, simple, and category-driven mobile application that allows users to centralize, categorize, and quickly retrieve all their personal saved links and content, transforming digital clutter into a well-managed personal library.


Usage:

This application is designed to act as a personal content curator where a user can:

⦁	Sign up and Log in to access their personal library.

⦁	Save a link (URL) to any content they discover online.

⦁	Categorize each saved content (e.g., Restaurant, Video, Article) for easy filtering.

⦁	View all their saved links in an organized list format.

⦁	Search and Filter their library to quickly find specific saved items.

⦁	Edit or Delete content entries as needed.

⦁	Manage basic Profile settings.
